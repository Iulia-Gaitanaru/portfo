                    Hey there!
                    I'm Iulia, I'm a student at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science in Brasov, Romania.I am an ambitious person, who seeks to evolve day by day both personally and professionally. </p>
                  <h3>Hobbies and things I like </h3>
                  <p>
                    I like to discover and evolve as much as possible in the IT field. I have prepared in the "Works" section some projects made by me that helped me to evolve on this plan.
                    I also like to travel a lot, to meet other cultures and people. I think that life is short and this world is too big and that's why we should take the time to discover it. There are so many beautiful places, things and people there, everywhere.
                    I like sports, I think I like dancing the most, because it relaxes me and transports me to a world only of mine. I like any type of art, reading and discovering good music.</p>
                  <h3>Work and evolution</h3>
                  <p>
                    I was born in Ploiesti, Romania. I finished my studies here, more precisely high school, and I moved to college in Brasov. I felt very lucky because I realized that I liked what I was doing, what I was learning and what I was going to become. I started working in the IT field in the second year of college, on artificial intelligence. Since then I have known the python programming language and discovered how much you can do with this language. On a personal level, I have tried all this time to become a better version of myself day by day, to try to get to know myself.
                    Now, at almost 22 years old, I am happy that I learned and I still have so much to learn.</p>
